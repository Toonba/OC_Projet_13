# OC_Projet_13 Use an API for a bank account with React

For this project we are part of Remede Agency and work on a project for a bank : ArgentBank
Our mission is to developp an app which allow user to connect and handle their account and profile (they should be able to change their name in the database). Once this mission is done they also asked to get our view regarding how they should code their API for their transaction feature which should allow user to see transaction and modify some details about them (category and personal notes)

Back-end used in this app can be found on [this Repository](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Project-10-Bank-API/tree/master)
